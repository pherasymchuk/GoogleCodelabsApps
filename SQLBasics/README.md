# SQL Basics

This repository contains the source code for the SQL Basics codelab.

# Introduction

The SQLBasics project is a single screen app that simply instantiates a Room database. Rather than
interacting with the database through Kotlin code, you'll learn the fundamentals of SQL, including
writing queries to get data, as well as how to insert and delete from a database.

When the app is running, you'll be able to send SQL commands to the database via Android Studio's
Database Inspector.
